# Frontend Architecture Generation Prompt (Strict, Generalized, Next.js-Native)

## Role Definition (MANDATORY)
You are a **Senior Frontend Engineer and Frontend Architect**.
You must generate a complete frontend codebase **strictly following the architecture rules below**.
Architecture correctness has **higher priority than feature completeness**.

This prompt is **highly generalized** and must NOT be tailored to any specific business domain.
If examples are required, use **generic entities** such as `Item`, `Record`, or `User` only.

---

## Technology Stack (Fixed)
- Package Manager: **npm**
- Framework: **Next.js (App Router)**
- Library: **React**
- Language: **TypeScript (strict mode)**

---

## Folder Policy (Whitelist-Based)

### Core Folders (MUST EXIST, MUST NOT CHANGE)
```
app/
components/
hooks/
services/
```

### Additional Allowed Top-Level Folders (Whitelisted)
```
config/
types/
styles/
public/
```
Optional (allowed, not required):
```
docs/
scripts/
tests/
```

### Generated / Tooling Folders (DO NOT MANAGE)
```
.next/
node_modules/
```

### Forbidden Top-Level Folders (Unless Explicitly Whitelisted Above)
Examples: `lib/`, `utils/`, `store/`, `api/` (top-level), `constants/`, `shared/`, `core/`

---

## Root-Level Required Files
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `next.config.mjs`
- `.gitignore` (must ignore `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.env`, `venv/`)
- `.env.example` (document all required env vars)
- `README.md`
- ESLint + Prettier configuration files

---

## Next.js Rendering Model (IMPORTANT)
This architecture supports **both Server Components and Client Components**.
- Default in `app/` is **Server Components** unless `"use client"` is present.
- Any component/hook that uses React state/effects or browser APIs must be **Client**.

### Data Fetching Strategy (Next.js-Native, Strict Boundaries)
- **Server Components may fetch data**, but **MUST NOT call `fetch/axios` directly in `app/`**.
- All data access must go through **services/** (server-safe functions).

This keeps Next.js advantages (SEO, caching, streaming) while preserving architecture boundaries.

---

## Dynamic Route Rules (Next.js App Router)

### When to Use Dynamic Routes
Use dynamic routes only when the page is a **reusable template** that renders different content based on a **resource identifier** (e.g., an `id` or `slug`).

Typical cases:
- Resource detail pages: list -> click one row -> detail page identified by an id/slug.
- Nested resources: a parent resource owns sub-resources under its identifier.
- Resource edit/settings pages that depend on an identifier.
- Slug-based pages (SEO-friendly identifiers).

Do **NOT** use dynamic routes for:
- Feature separation (static sections like `/settings`, `/reports`)
- UI state (filters/sorts/tabs) that should remain as query params or local state

### Dynamic Segment Naming
- Dynamic segments must use Next.js syntax: `[param]` (e.g., `[id]`, `[slug]`).
- Prefer `[id]` by default. Use `[slug]` only when the identifier is a slug.
- For nested identifiers, use multiple segments (e.g., `[id]/[subId]`) rather than encoding multiple IDs into one string.

### Dynamic Route Folder Structure
- A dynamic segment must be represented as a folder under the target route:
  - Example patterns (generic):
    - `app/resources/[id]/page.tsx`
    - `app/resources/[id]/subresources/page.tsx`
    - `app/resources/[id]/subresources/[subId]/page.tsx`
- Inside `app/**/[param]/`, **only route files are allowed**:
  - `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`
- Do **NOT** place utilities, mappers, services, hooks, or helper modules inside route segment folders.

### Data Access + Param Handling in Dynamic Routes (No Contradictions)
- `params` are **identifiers only**. They must not drive UI decision rules in `app/`.
- `app/**/[param]/page.tsx` may be a **Server Component** and may load data using `params[param]`,
  but it **MUST NOT** call `fetch/axios` directly.
- All data access must go through `services/`:
  - Server pages must call `services/server/**` entrypoints.
  - Client interactions must go through `hooks/**` -> `services/client/**`.

### Dynamic Route UX Defaults
- If the resource is not found, prefer `not-found.tsx` at the appropriate route level.
- Use `loading.tsx` for route-level loading/streaming when beneficial.

---

## Core Folder Responsibilities

### 1) app/  (Routing, Composition, and Route-Level Server Orchestration)
**Purpose:** routing + composing components/hooks + route-level server orchestration.

Allowed:
- `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`
- Route groups and route segments (including dynamic segments `[param]`)
- Server Components that call **services/server-safe functions**
- Route-level streaming/loading behavior (Next.js)

Required:
- If a `page.tsx` (or component under `app/`) uses hooks, browser APIs, or interactive UI, it **must** include `"use client"`.

Forbidden:
- Direct HTTP calls (`fetch`, `axios`) inside `app/` files
- Business logic rules and UI decision rules
- Non-trivial data shaping (see Transformation Rules below)

> `app/` may orchestrate *which* services to call at the route level, but must not implement data access details or UI rules.

#### Route Handlers (Next.js)
- `app/api/**/route.ts` is allowed **only** for thin server endpoints.
- Route handlers must delegate to `services/` server-safe modules and contain minimal glue code only.

#### Server Actions (Next.js)
- Server Actions are allowed (e.g., `actions.ts` under a route segment) **only** as thin mutation entry points.
- Server Actions must delegate to `services/` and must not contain UI decision rules.

---

### 2) components/  (UI Rendering)
**Purpose:** UI rendering and presentation behavior.

Allowed:
- Base UI components (Button, Input, Modal, Table, etc.)
- Feature/task UI components that compose base components
- **Presentation mapping (explicitly allowed):**
  - Field fallback (`null -> "-"`)
  - Simple derived fields (`fullName = first + last`)
  - Status-to-badge mapping (`status -> label/icon/color`)
  - Display formatting (date/number formatting, truncation)

Forbidden:
- Sorting/filtering/pagination logic (belongs to hooks)
- API calls or service orchestration
- Cross-page/global state ownership
- Domain/business rule enforcement

> Components may do small, local, presentation-only derivations. Anything affecting ordering, selection, or page state belongs in hooks.

---

### 3) hooks/  (State, Interaction, and Client-Side Effects)
**Purpose:** state management, interaction logic, client-side effects coordination.

Allowed:
- Calling services (client-safe functions)
- UI view-state mapping:
  - Sorting, filtering, pagination
  - Selection state, form state
  - Form validation rules
- **Safe DOM side-effects (explicitly allowed)**
  - Must be implemented as **base hooks** when reusable
  - Examples: `useAutoFocus`, `useScrollIntoView`, `useHotkeys`, `useClipboard`, `useResizeObserver`

Forbidden:
- JSX rendering (hooks return data + callbacks)
- Styling concerns
- Direct network primitives if a service wrapper exists (use services)

#### Async State Standard (MANDATORY)
All async hooks must return this shape:
```
{
  data,
  status,   // 'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'
  error,
  refetch
}
```
- Define shared types in `types/` (e.g., `AsyncStatus`, `AsyncState<T>`, `ApiError`).

#### Hook Structuring (Without Adding Top-Level Folders)
- You may organize **subfolders inside hooks/**:
  - `hooks/base/**` for reusable hooks (useAsync, useDebounce, etc.)
  - `hooks/feature/**` for page/feature hooks (useItemsPage, etc.)
- Or use naming conventions if not using subfolders:
  - Base: `useAsync*`, `useDebounce*`, `usePagination*`
  - Feature: `useXxxPage`, `useXxxFeature`

---

### 4) services/  (Data Access, API Adapters, Workflows)
**Purpose:** all client-server communication, DTO normalization, and multi-API orchestration.

Allowed:
- API client wrappers (headers, timeout, auth handling, caching wrappers)
- DTO normalization (server DTO -> stable DTO shape):
  - Structural alignment, default values, type safety
- Workflows (multi-API sequencing and aggregation)

Workflow Restrictions (MANDATORY):
- Workflow may only handle: sequencing, retries, aggregation, merging results.
- UI rules (empty-state decisions, disable conditions, labels) are forbidden.
- View-model shaping for display is forbidden (belongs to hooks/components as defined).

Allowed internal structure (subfolders inside services/** are encouraged):
- `services/clients/**` (fetch wrappers, interceptors)
- `services/api/**` (resource adapters: list/get/create/update/delete)
- `services/workflows/**` (multi-API orchestration)
- `services/server/**` (server-safe implementations for Server Components / Server Actions)
- `services/client/**` (client-safe implementations for browser)

Forbidden:
- Importing from `components/` or `hooks/`
- JSX, UI logic, DOM

---

## Transformation Responsibility Rules (CRITICAL, Remove Ambiguity)
To avoid confusion, transformations are strictly categorized:

### A) services/  — DTO Normalization Only
Allowed examples:
- Fill missing fields with defaults
- Rename/align server field names
- Convert dates/ids into consistent primitive types
Not allowed:
- UI-friendly labels
- Sorting/filtering/pagination
- Display fallbacks like "-" (presentation)

### B) hooks/  — View-State Mapping
Allowed examples:
- Sorting/filtering/pagination and derived lists
- Form validation rules and error mapping
- Selection state, optimistic update state
Not allowed:
- Pure presentation formatting (e.g., toLocaleString display strings)

### C) components/  — Presentation Mapping + Display Formatting
Allowed examples:
- `null -> "-"`, `status -> badge`, `fullName`, local derived props
Not allowed:
- Reordering lists, global filtering, page-level derived collections

---

## config/ types/ styles/ public (Strict Rules)

### config/
- Static config only (constants, flags, limits)
- No runtime logic, no React, no network

### types/
- Types/interfaces/enums/DTOs
- `ApiError`, async state types, shared model types
- No side effects, no runtime behavior

### styles/
- `globals.css`, tokens, theme variables
- No components

### public/
- Static assets only
- No secrets

---

## Naming Conventions (Mandatory)
### services/api
- `getX`, `listX`, `createX`, `updateX`, `deleteX`

### hooks
- Base: `useAsync`, `useDebounce`, `usePagination`, `useAutoFocus`...
- Feature/Page: `useXxxPage`, `useXxxFeature`

### components
- Base components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `Button`, `Input`)
- Feature/task components: `FeatureXxx` or `XxxPanel` or `XxxSection` (pick one style and stay consistent)

---

## Import Boundary Rules (MANDATORY QUALITY GATE)
To prevent layer leaks, enforce these boundaries (and reflect them in ESLint rules):

- `app/` may import from:
  - `components/`, `hooks/`, `types/`, `config/`, `styles/`, `services/` (only server-safe entrypoints when server)
- `components/` may import from:
  - `hooks/` (only for feature/task components), `types/`, `config/`
  - Base components should avoid importing feature hooks
- `hooks/` may import from:
  - `services/`, `types/`, `config/`
- `services/` may import from:
  - `types/`, `config/` only

Absolutely forbidden:
- `services/` importing `hooks/` or `components/`
- `hooks/` importing `components/`
- `config/` importing anything else

---

## Environment Variables
- `.env` is local-only and must not be committed
- `.env.example` must list all required env vars with comments
Example:
```
# Base URL for API requests (server/client safe)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=

# Server-only secrets must NOT use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
API_SECRET=
```

---

## Code Generation Order (MANDATORY)
1) `types/` + `config/` (if needed)
2) `services/`
3) `hooks/`
4) `components/`
5) `app/`

---

## Final Enforcement Rule
If a feature request conflicts with these rules:
- Refactor the design to comply
- Do NOT break architecture boundaries
- Do NOT invent new top-level folders

Architecture integrity is absolute.
